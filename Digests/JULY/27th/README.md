Qyno is a blockchain-based financial 
ecosystem centered around Qyno Coin, a high performance digital currency.

Qyno aims to bring the cryptocurrency world closer to the real world through the use of 
Qyno Coin, our highly applicable and adoptable digital currency. Qyno Coin (QNO) is embedded with 
InstantSend and PrivateSend featurues, making QNO transactions instant, anonymous and nearly 
free to send. With Qyno, businesses finally have a solution for trading assets and goods in a secure, 
low-cost environment that allows them to reach their financial objectives. 




### Qyno Project

Qyno project's goal is the development of tools and products that can allow everyone acces to faster, safer, anonymous, and near-zero cost financial products
 and services. Having meticulously studied and tested existing blockchain-based financial products and networks, we created Qyno with the aim of becoming a reference in 
the blockchain financial services sector after concluding that others fail to deliver on the goals which are our vision.

Predecessors are meant to be learned from and eventually overcome. If this weren't the case, we would still be stuck with Friendster for social networking or Napster for 
peer-to-peer sharing. Bitcoin may be just such a predecessor, yet there isn't enough being done in the blockchain space to move beyond its slow transaction times and 
exorbitant fees.

The core of the Qyno Project is Qyno Coin (QNO), a digital currency based on the latest blockchain technology and network architecture created go beyond Bitcoin by 
providing seamless, instant, and low cost transactions secured by masternodes.
